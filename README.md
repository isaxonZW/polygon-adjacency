# polygon-adjacency
# This code uses shapely to calculate polygon adjacency
The script reads a set of polygons defined by coordinate tuples and creates Shapely polygon objects. It then checks which polygons share an edge using the touches() method and stores these adjacency relationships in a dictionary. Finally, it prints the dictionary showing which polygons are adjacent to each other.
